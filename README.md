# repLookup

A SMS based application to get your state and national reps' contact information on your phone üá∫üá∏ ‚òéÔ∏è 

<img src="screenshot.png" width="300">

This application uses the [Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro), [Open States API](http://docs.openstates.org/api/index.html), [Sunlight Foundation Congress API](https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/) (soon to be merged with ProPublica Congress API), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com), and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for deployment.

### Setup:

### Open States API

Register for an Open States API key [here](https://openstates.org/api/register/). The process is pretty quick and free. You might consider making a [donation to the project](https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/open-states-general-support-fund) too while you are at it. 

(TODO: Implement API key)

## Google Maps Geocoding API

You will need to get a [Google Maps API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) to use this application. After you have gotten a key, store it as an environment variable. To run it locally, you can store it like this:

```
export GOOGLEMAPSKEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

## Twilio API

You will also need a Twilio account and phone number. Since this takes advantage of webhooks/TwiML, you don't need to store any Twilio credentials, but you do need to have a public facing server. Locally, you can create this with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com). If you deploy the application to Heroku or other hosting options, you can use the address for the application as part of your setup. 

(TODO: Add pictures of Twilio settings and more details)

### FAQs:

**Is it sketchy to give a random number your address?**
Kinda. I wouldn't personally give a stranger my address. A few things to know: The addresses and phone numbers are not being used for anything other than lookup. Be aware: Twilio will have a record of it in their logs though. 

**Why do I need to give an exact address and not just a zip code?**
Sometimes a single zip code can be part of multiple districts. For the most accurate results, latitude and longitude of addresses is being used for lookup. Future versions will be smarter about this.
